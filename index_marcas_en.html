			<p class="marca_txt_large">This is a brand that I helped create in early high school, drawing the shape of the circumscribed 'Z', accompanied by a rectangle with the name. It was created to represent a snack delivery company. Here are some of the visual communications with the brand application:</p>
			<img src="img/cmyk/2_marcas/zapt_zum/zaptzum_colorido_frente_1_2.jpg"><p class="marca_legenda_large">Front of the colored folder, with 3 folds in accordion and printed in glossy couch of 150 grams.</p>
			<img src="img/cmyk/2_marcas/zapt_zum/zaptzum_colorido_verso_1_2.jpg"><p class="marca_legenda_large">Back of the colored folder</p>
			<img src="img/cmyk/2_marcas/zapt_zum/zaptzum_monocromatico.jpg"><p class="marca_legenda_large">Two-sided monochrome folder, with one fold in half and printed on 200g recycled paper.</p>
			<p class="marca_txt_large">At the time I drew several sketches of the brand, which already had a name thought and my mother Ariane Cole finalized the arts in Corel Draw, including choosing the colors. The company was created by my father Artur Cole, to deliver healthy and light snacks in the neighborhood of the "Bosque da Sa√∫de" - "Forest of Health" (an interesting coincidecidence). The main menu was the snacks and salads; which contained or accompanied various types of: breads, cheeses, cold cuts, salads, mousses, ice creams, beverages and juices both natural and pulp. It was the first brand I helped create.</p>

			<p class="marca_txt_large">This is a brand I created during the Graphic Design graduation in 2012, but the history of the group it represents is a bit older. In 2004 the group of studies was born, formed by friends (with me included), to discuss philosophy and comics, the meetings usually happened in PUC-SP. After we have talked a lot about the related inherent concepts between our readings; the need arises to produce. Over the next few years we have created 2 zines, promoted one philosophical coffee, made several designs and began to meet in other places. In 2009 I created the site / blog where we produce many texts and still continue to produce (although it is less often), know the site in this <a href="https://neomitosofia.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">link</a>. And more recently we started producing videos and podcasts to publish on our networks, check out some of these productions in our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcbp_C16boz2RGibsKzOxWw" target="_blank">Youtube Channel</a>.<br>This brand has undergone several evaluation processes, with teachers, group partners and other friends, participating in the critiques and enhancements. Here are some more elaborate sketches:</p>

			</div>
			<p class="marca_txt_large">In addition to the digital sketches above, I also produced a few others in college notebooks. But most people preferred this version of the brand and so I finalized it with the name and motto of the group attached at the top. Using a specific typography to talk to a cover that I had already created for the group, during the creation of a project for the "VIVA LEITURA" - "LIVE READING" contest. Here's the cover:</p>

			<p class="marca_txt_large">This is a brand I created when opening the 2C3D company with my brother William Cole in 2016. The name '2C3D' has the following meanings: two Coles (last name of the members), two heads and two computers creating 3D arts. We initially offered 3D modeling and some time later we expanded our services to 3D printing. The brand story began with my parents, my brother and I making several sketches on paper, choosing four of these ideas and developing them digitally. Here are a few sketches of these 4 brand ideas.</p>
			<img src="img/cmyk/2_marcas/2c3d/esbocos_calice1.jpg"><p class="marca_legenda_large">Sketches of the chalice-shaped or heads-shaped brand, created by me.</p>
			<img src="img/cmyk/2_marcas/2c3d/esbocos_cubo_e_tetraedro.jpg"><p class="marca_legenda_large">Sketches of cube-shaped and tetrahedron-shaped brands, created by my brother.</p>
			<p class="marca_txt_large">With these four ideas improved and finalized; we launched on facebook a poll, so that our contacts choose the brand that we would officially use with the company. Here is an image that shows the 4 competitors and also some sketches of the brand in the form of electronic circuits, which was chosen in the poll.</p>
			<img src="img/cmyk/2_marcas/2c3d/marcas_finais1.jpg"><p class="marca_legenda_large">The four brands that competed in the Facebook poll.</p>
			<img src="img/cmyk/2_marcas/2c3d/esbocos_chip1.jpg"><p class="marca_legenda_large">Sketches of the brand in the form of electronic circuits, winner of the poll, idea and improvement of my authorship.</p>
			<p class="marca_txt_large">With the chosen brand, we finish all our visual communications: card, flyer, posters, digital banners and the own site, which can be accessed in the <a href="https://2c3d.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">link</a>; here are images of some of these arts:</p>
			<img src="img/cmyk/2_marcas/2c3d/cartao_flyer.jpg"><p class="marca_legenda_large">Card and flyer created for our company.</p>
			<img src="img/cmyk/2_marcas/2c3d/2c3d_cartazes.jpg"><p class="marca_legenda_large">The two original posters designs. then enhanced for workshops and other marketings.</p>
			<p class="marca_txt_large">It was created the company, the brand, only needed to divulge and with these arts in hands, we left to spread our company in universities, fablabs, cultural centers and schools. To provide our 3D modeling services, 3D prints and later workshops on the techniques we use in our work.</p>

			<p class="marca_txt_large">This is a brand I created as a partnership for two of my brother's friends. Illustrating the three main characteristics of their company, in the case: the name of the company 'Pepper', the fact that they had names that began with the letter 'C' (Carolina and Caroline) and the fact that they want a triangle(s) in the brand. The history of the brand is brief, but with good sketches, so here are some of them.</p>
